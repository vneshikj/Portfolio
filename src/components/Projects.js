            This flappy bird clone was developed using VHDL and deployed on a
            Cyclone 5 FPGA. This project involved the design of a finite state
            machine, as well as components for VGA output and synchronization.

            An American sign language interpreter built in Python using PyTorch
            and PyQt5 for the UI.

            <br />
            The interpreter features three different AI models which can
            translate ASL. Users can also upload their own photos or use the
            camera feed within the app.
